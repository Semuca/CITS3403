## Setting up the project development environment
- First, create the development environment using `python3 -m venv .venv`. This will create a virtual environment folder called *.venv*
- Activate the virtual environment folder using `source .venv/bin/activate`. You will know this has worked if a **(.venv)** prefix has appeared in your CLI
- Install project dependencies

## Running the project
After setting up the virtual environment and installing the dependencies, run `flask --app main run`
- Alternatively, Visual Studio Code's launch.json the project can be run from the 'Run and Debug' tool (F5)
